## Notes

- [How to connect sql server container](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47984603/using-sql-server-management-studio-to-remote-connect-to-docker-container)
- Check container for MySql
- Migrate database from local to container
- Connect to PySpark âœ…
- Containarize python scripts (Consumers, Producers and Pipeline).
- Connect with BI Tool
- Update README.md
- Think of which graphs we want (To know what data do we need):
  - Viewers vs/and chatters per stream (Linechart)
  - Viewers who are the most active (Barchar)
  - Subscribers vs Followers vs Just Watching (Piechart)
  - Top most used words (Barchar?)
  - Hour with more views (Barchar,Line)
  - More relevant topic (?)
